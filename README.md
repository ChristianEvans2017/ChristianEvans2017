### Welcome to my profile!

My name is Christian Evans and I currently hail from the Tampa Bay area. I'm a math tutor, a former business analyst, a huge history buff, and an avid science nerd. In 2017, I graduated from Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI with a degree in Supply Chain Management and another in Information Technology. In the medium-to-near term (provided that it works with my professional pursuits) I plan on continuing my education in a graduate program for Applied Statistics or Data Science.

### My Programming Background
* I've been programming for around seven years. Generally programming has been a hobby, a hack to automate small tasks at work, or to fulfill my academic pursuits. Now I'm excited to finally share the things I've built, collaborate with other programmers, get involved with open source projects, and ultimately, land my first job as a developer.
* I have experience with C#, Java, Javascript, and VBA but my heart belongs to Python. It's such a beautiful language! Bravo, Guido van Rossum, Bravo! Writing Python is almost like writing poetry.
* As a self-proclaimed math geek, it's no surprise that my main areas of interest in programming revolve around machine learning. I also love to make math art as a hobby.

### My Resume, LinkedIn Profile, and Programming Experience
* You can find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-evans-marquette17
* Additionally, my resume can be found at https://github.com/ChristianEvans2017/MyResume

Within my resume and LinkedIn profile, you will see that I have completed several MIT courses facilitated by edX.org. As my GitHub profile is built out, I will post repositories containing some of the coolest projects I've built in these courses.

### Under Construction: What's Currently in the Pipeline
I've built numerous projects, many of which are in the Machine Learning arena; however, publishing my code is brand new to me. In the coming weeks, I will be posting
repositories containing these projects. I want to ensure that when these repositories are posted, the files are arranged in such a way that they may be useful for
others working on similar projects. In the meantime, if you'd like to see some of the code I've written or models I've built, please reach out! I'd  be happy to give you an early showcase! Here are some projects that have already been posted or will be coming soon to my profile:

* A Perceptron Classifier - To showcase the humble, early days of my Machine Learning Journey
* A Linear Regression Algorithm featuring Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Similarly, a Polynomial Regression Algorithm
* The K-Means and K-Mediods Clustering Algorithms
* A "From-Scratch" Neural Network, tasked with digit recognition on MNIST, which uses only Python's standard Library and Numpy
* A Recommender System featuring the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm
* A Convolutional Neural Network which reads images of sudoku puzzles and then solves them
* A Crossword Puzzle Solver featuring Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read puzzles, and a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to interpret puzzle clues and predict their solutions - This one is tough! I have made solid progress on this project and am eagerly awaiting the day when I get to share it with you all!
* An OpenpyXL project - I am and always have been a MS Excel nerd. Discovering the OpenpyXL library was a dream come true. I use this library weekly and am still deciding what project(s) I will share.
* Various small algorithms I've implemented to solve problems from the folks at Daily Coding Problem
* Math Art Projects! Shocker - the math tutor likes to make math aesthetically pleasing using matplotlib. Additionally, I may post some symbolic computation projects I've built with the Sympy library.
* Lastly, several projects written in other languages than Python, such as Java and VBA

Stay tuned! I look forward to sharing with you!

### Put Me to Work!
My primary goal is, of course, to land my first developer job; however, that's not the only thing I'm looking for. For years, I've heard all about the wonderful open source community out there, especially in the Python-sphere. I want in! I'd love to contribute! If you stumble across my profile and know of an open source contribution opportunity, I'd be thrilled if you let me know about it. Collaboration and mission are essential when learning and building skills. I'm ready to help out wherever I can!
